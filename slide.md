# RunesDAO+ Pitch Deck

---

## Slide 1: Title

**RunesDAO+**

Cross-Chain Governance & Private Payments

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

*   **Fragmented Ecosystems:** Bitcoin holders have limited access to the vibrant world of DAOs on other chains like Starknet.
*   **Poor User Experience:** Complicated bridging, gas fees, and public transactions create high barriers to entry for new users.
*   **Lack of Privacy:** Subscription models in Web3 are often public, exposing user data and transaction history.

---

## Slide 3: Our Solution

**RunesDAO+ is a platform that bridges the gap between Bitcoin and Starknet, offering:**

*   **Runes-Based Governance:** Allowing Bitcoin Runes holders to participate in DAO governance on Starknet.
*   **Gasless Transactions:** An AVNU Paymaster integration provides a seamless, gas-free user experience.
*   **Private Subscriptions:** ZK-TLS proofs enable private, secure, and recurring payments.

---

## Slide 4: How It Works

A multi-layered architecture for a seamless Web3 experience:

*   **Identity:** `RunesAuth` and `Xverse Wallet` for secure Bitcoin-based identity.
*   **Gasless UX:** `AVNU Paymaster` sponsors transactions for a user-friendly experience.
*   **Privacy:** `Wootzapp SDK` and `ZK-TLS` for private, verifiable on-chain actions.
*   **Smart Contracts:** Secure and scalable contracts on `Starknet` written in `Cairo`.
*   **Cross-Chain:** `Atomiq SDK` for bridging assets between Bitcoin and Starknet.

---

## Slide 5: Target Audience

*   **Bitcoin Holders:** Who want to do more with their assets and participate in DAOs.
*   **DAO Enthusiasts:** Looking for better governance models and a more engaged user base.
*   **Web3 Developers:** Who need a simple and private way to implement subscription models.

---

## Slide 6: Market Opportunity

*   **The Rise of Bitcoin Runes:** A rapidly growing ecosystem of assets and users on the Bitcoin network.
*   **The Need for Better DAOs:** The DAO market is constantly evolving, with a clear need for better tooling and user experience.
*   **The Subscription Economy:** A massive market that is ripe for disruption with privacy-preserving Web3 technologies.

---

## Slide 7: Business Model

*   **Transaction Fees:** A small percentage fee on sponsored transactions.
*   **Premium Features:** Offer advanced features for DAOs, such as custom governance models or enhanced analytics.
*   **Subscription Platform:** Take a small cut from the subscription fees processed through the platform.
